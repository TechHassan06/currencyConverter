A custom React hook fetches exchange rates from an external API.

Currency options are dynamically populated from API data.

The conversion logic calculates values based on selected currencies.

React state updates the UI instantly without page reloads.

Dark gradient background for a premium feel

Glassmorphism card using backdrop blur and transparency

Minimal, focused layout for better usability
